Spatula is an SPA server for debugging/testing purposes. It allows you to serve your Single Page Applications like React, Svelte and more. It also has live-server capabilities so you can update the web view as soon as you perform changes.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is currently WIP, You can download the source code and build it using `truct do` however the application is merely tested and probably too unstable.
